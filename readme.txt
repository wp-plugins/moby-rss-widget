Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This plugin was born out of an explicable problem with the standard 
Wordpress RSS widget on my server. Whether a curl problem within 
fetch_feed() or something else, this plugin now uses DOM to load 
the feeds rather than curl. If you're getting the "An error has 
occurred; the feed is probably down. Try again later." message (and 
you are sure that your feed is valid (validate with 
feedvalidator.org) try this plugin.

Installation

	directory
2. 	Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

How to Use
